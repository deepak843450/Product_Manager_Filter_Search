# Product_Manager_Filter_Search


Here I have made Filter Search where we can filter data by using search bar.
I have used MySql database for dataset.
I have used SpringBoot, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, ThymeLeaf and Hibernate.
If you want to use this project than you have to create a database in MySql using database name "sales" and on that database you have to create a table using table name "product" and on that table you have to create four columns using name " 'id', 'name', 'brand', 'madein', 'price' ".
After that you have to set the MySql database username and password in the ProductManagerFilterSearch project. Just go to application.properties file and change username and password of your own database username and password.
Thats all! Now you can run this project in your system.
